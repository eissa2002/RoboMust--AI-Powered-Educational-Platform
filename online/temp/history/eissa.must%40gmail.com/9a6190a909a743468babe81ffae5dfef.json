    "text": "Object detection is a task in computer vision where you want to identify and locate objects within an image or video. The goal is to put a bounding box around each object of interest, like a car or a person, and label it correctly.\n\nThink of it like trying to find specific items on a shelf. You need to not only identify what's there but also pinpoint its exact location so you can pick it up. In the same way, in object detection, you're identifying objects within an image and specifying where they are by drawing a box around them.\n\nTo achieve this, you often use features extracted from images, which help your model understand what's going on in the scene. These features can be thought of as building blocks that describe different aspects of the image, like edges or textures.\n\nNow, let me ask: How do these feature descriptions relate to object detection?",
